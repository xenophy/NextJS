There are three ways to write links.  Each is easier to read than the last:

Here's an inline link to [Google](http://www.google.com/).
Here's a reference-style link to [Google] [1].
Here's a very readable link to [Yahoo!].

  [1]: http://www.google.com/
  [yahoo!]: http://www.yahoo.com/

The link definitions can appear anywhere in the document -- before or after the place where you use them.  The link definition names (`1` and `Yahoo!`) can be any unique string, and are case-insensitive; `[Yahoo!]` is the same as `[YAHOO!]`.
